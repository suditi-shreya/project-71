Srikant which was further extended to classes I to X. This programme is an endeavor to make learning easy. Learning is now different and stress free. This is a unique and novel tool which very creatively uses the medium of sports to teach Mathematics and Science.

The visual images associated with sports like cricket, basketball, chess and tennis make education an exhilarating experience for the students and it takes a step over the conventional chalk and talk method. Complex concepts are thus made easy with creative, humorous & interesting images. Modules are constantly updated with relevant sessions and assignments.</p>
